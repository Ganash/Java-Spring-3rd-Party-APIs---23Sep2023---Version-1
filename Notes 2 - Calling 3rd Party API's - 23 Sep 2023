Let's start implementing all the controllers that are present in productcontroller


Q) What is the purpose of controller?

A) The purpose of controller is:

1. Controller Takes request from client
2. Controller Parses or takes out the parameters from the request
3. Controller Calls the service with those particular parameters


Q) What do you think that getAllProducts() should actually return?
A) It should return list of products.

Q) Are we currently storing the products in our DB?
A)

1. No, these models (BaseModel, Category, Product) are not getting stored anywhere.
2. In fact the models which we are going to get, They are replica of how they are being storead at FakeStore. Not in DB
3. The products which I am going to get or return from proxy server. The products which I am going to get will know how FakeStore is giving.

For Example:

In Product.java (models package). I have something called ImageURL. Do you think Fakestore will have ImageURL. FakeStore had something called Image.

---------------

So what we are going to do now is:

In FakeStoreProductServiceImpl.java, what will get on products of FakeStoreProductServiceImpl. Ideally services should return internal models. Ideally services should return than I know about. Tomorrow I want move the proxy from FakeStore to some other API or Database etc

Q) Do you think that I should make return type of ProductService interface to be what is being written by Fakestore or I should make the return type what I want and then convert what FakeStore want to my format?

Same Question Q) Should I keep the return type what exactly what FakeStore has or I should decide what return type to be return and whatever fakestore is returning, I will be converting to that?

A) I will decide what should return
